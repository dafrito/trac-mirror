Trac 0.8.1 Release Notes
========================
Feb 28, 2005

We're proud to present our latest release - Trac 0.8.1.

Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system, integrated with
Subversion, for software development projects. Trac uses a minimalistic
approach to web-based software project management. Our mission is simple; to
help developers write great software while staying out of the way. Trac should
impose as little as possible on a team's established development process and
policies.

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating
links and useful structure between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki
pages.  A timeline view presents all project events in chronological order,
making tracking progress or getting an overview of a project easy.
