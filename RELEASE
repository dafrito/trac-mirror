Trac 0.5.2 Release Notes
========================
March 2, 2004

Edgewall Software is pleased to announce the release of Trac 0.5.2.

Trac is a minimalistic web-based software project management and bug/issue

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, to create 
links and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki
pages.  A timeline shows all project events in order, making getting an
overview of the project and tracking progress very easy.
