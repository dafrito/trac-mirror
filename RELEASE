Trac 0.6 (Solanum) Release Notes
================================
March 23, 2004

Edgewall Software is pleased to announce the release of Trac 0.6 'Solanum'.

Trac is a minimalistic web-based software project management and bug/issue
tracking system. It provides an interface to the Subversion revision control
systems, an integrated wiki, flexible issue tracking and convenient report
facilities. 

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating
links and useful structure between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki
pages.  A timeline view presents all project events in chronological order,
making tracking progress or getting an overview of a project easy.
