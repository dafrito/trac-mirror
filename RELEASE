Trac 0.5.1 Release Notes
========================
Feb 25, 2004

Edgewall Software is pleased to announce the release of Trac 0.5.1.

Trac is a minimalistic web-based software project management and bug/issue
tracking system. It provides an interface to revision control systems
(Subversion), an integrated Wiki and convenient report facilities. 

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, to create 
links and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki
pages.  A timeline shows all project events in order, making getting an
overview of the project and tracking progress very easy.

The software is published under the GNU General Public License, and is
available for download at:
