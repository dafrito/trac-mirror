= Trac Links =

As you might have guessed, TracLinks are a very fundamental feature of Trac.

They allow easy hyperlinking to files, changesets, bugs/issues and wiki pages from anywhere in the system where WikiFormatting is used. 

TracLinks can refer to tickets, reports and changesets by simply writing the
ticket, report and changeset numbers in the following notation:
{{{
 * Ticket #1 or ticket:1
 * Report {1} or report:1
 * Changeset [1] or changeset:1
 * File source:trunk/COPYING.
}}}
Display:
 * Ticket #1 or ticket:1
 * Report {1} or report:1
 * Changeset [1] or changeset:1
 * File source:trunk/COPYING.

Trac links can also be given a custom link title like this:
{{{
[ticket:1 This is a link to ticket number one].
}}}

Display:

[ticket:1 This is a link to ticket number one].

It seems a simple enough concept at a glance, but actually allows quite a complex network of information. 

In practice, it's very intuitive and simple to use, and we've found the "link trail" extremely helpful to better understand what's happening in a project or why a particular change was made.

== source: links ==

The default behavior for a source:/some/path link is to open the directory browser if the path points
to a directory and otherwise open the log view. It's also possible to link directly to a specific
revision of a file like this: source:/some/file#123 or like this to link to the latest revision:
source:/some/file#latest.

== Where to use TracLinks ==
You can use TracLinks in:

 * Wiki pages
 * Ticket descriptions
 * Source code (Subversion) commit messages
