= Trac Links =

As you might have guessed, TracLinks are a very fundamental feature of Trac.

They allow easy hyperlinking to files, changesets, bugs/issues and wiki pages from anywhere in the system where WikiFormatting is used. 

TracLinks can refer to tickets, reports and changesets by simply writing the
ticket, report and changeset numbers in the following notation:
{{{
 * Ticket #1 
 * Report {1}
 * Changeset [1]
 * File svn:trunk/COPYING.
}}}
Display:
 * Ticket #1 
 * Report {1}
 * Changeset [1]
 * File svn:trunk/COPYING.
 
It seems a simple enough concept at a glance, but actually allows quite a complex network of information. 

In practice, it's very intuitive and simple to use, and we've found the "link trail" extremely helpful to better understand what's happening in a project or why a particular change was made.

== Where to use TracLinks ==

 * Wiki pages
