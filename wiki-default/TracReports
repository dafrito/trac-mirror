= Trac Reports =
The Trac reports module provides a simple, yet powerful reporting facility
for presenting information about tickets from the Trac database.

== Creating Custom Reports ==

Creating a custom report requires knowing and using the SQL query language.

A report is basically a single named SQL query, executed and presented by
Trac.  Reports can be viewed and created from a custom SQL expression directly
in from the web interface.

Typically, a report consists of a SELECT-expression from the 'ticket' table,
using the available columns and sorting the way you want it.

== Ticket columns ==
The '''ticket'' table has the following columns:
 * id
 * time
 * changetime
 * component
 * severity  
 * priority 
 * owner
 * reporter
 * cc
 * url
 * version -- Version of the project does this ticket pertains to.
 * milestone
 * status
 * resolution
 * summary
 * description

See TracTickets for a detailed description of the column fields.

== Special Columns ==
To format the report properly, Trac needs to know the meaning of some result
columns . This is a list of column names of special meaning to Trac:
 * '''ticket''' -- Ticket ID number. Will become a hyperlink to that ticket.

''Note: In upcoming releases, there will be more special columns added, to create color-coded reports, grouping and other nifty features.''



== Sample Reports ==
'''status and summary for all tickets'''

{{{
SELECT id as ticket, status, summary FROM ticket
}}}

----
'''all active tickets, sorted by priority and time'''

{{{
SELECT id AS ticket, status, severity, priority, owner, 
       time as created, summary FROM ticket 
  WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened')
  ORDER BY priority, time
}}}

----
'''active tickets, grouped by milestone and sorted by priority'''

{{{
SELECT id AS ticket, milestone, status, severity, 
       priority, component, owner, summary 
  FROM ticket 
  WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened')
  ORDER BY milestone, 
    (CASE priority 
      WHEN 'highest' THEN 0 
      WHEN 'high' THEN 1 
      WHEN 'normal' THEN 2 
      WHEN 'low' THEN 3 
      ELSE 4 
    END), severity, time
}}}
