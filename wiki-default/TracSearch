== Quickjumps ==
However, for intermediate and advanced use, Trac has a useful way to quickly navigate to a given module and information item, called '''quickjumps'''.

If you enter a [wiki:TracLinks TracLink] in the search field above the navigation bar, Trac will recognize this and assume you know where you're going. 

'''Note:''' ''This is a particularly useful feature to quickly navigate to a specific issue ticket or changeset.''

=== Advanced: Disabling quickjumps ===
To disable the quickjump feature in a search - to for example search for all occurences of !TracGuide - begin the query with an exclamation mark (!).
