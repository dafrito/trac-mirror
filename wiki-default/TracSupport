= Trac Support =

Like in most [http://www.opensource.org/ open source projects], "free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/MailingList mailing list] and the project wiki.

There is also an [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/IrcChannel IRC channel], where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.
