= Trac Support =

Like in most [http://www.opensource.org/ open source projects], "free" Trac support is available primarily through the community itself, mainly through the [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/MailingList mailing list] and the project wiki.

There is also an [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/IrcChannel IRC channel], where people might be able to help out. Much of the 'live' development discussions also happen there.

== Commercial Support ==
Edgewall also offers commercial support to individuals and organizations who desire it. 

For more information, visit our [http://www.edgewall.com/products/trac/support.html commercial support page] for Trac.

You can of course also contact us at any time at [mailto:info@edgewall.com info@edgewall.com] if you have any questions.
