= The Trac Roadmap =

The roadmap provides a view on the [wiki:TracTickets ticket system] that helps planning and managing the future development of a project.

== The Roadmap View ==

Basically, the roadmap is just a list of all future milestones. You can add a description to each milestone (using WikiFormatting) that describes the main objectives, for example. In addition, all tickets targetted for a milestone are aggregated, and the ratio between active and resolved tickets is displayed as a milestone progress bar.

== The Milestone View ==

It is possible to drill down into this simple statistic by viewing the individual milestone pages. By default, the active/resolved ratio will be grouped and displayed by component, but you can also group the status by other criteria, such as the ticket owner or the severity. The ticket numbers are linked to queries of the ticket system that will display a listing of all the corresponding tickets.

== Roadmap Administration ==

It is possible to add, modify and remove milestones using either TracAdmin or the web interface. Note that the milestone descriptions can currently only be edited from the web interface. If you have the appropriate permissions, you'll see links below the main navigation bar that will allow you to add, edit or delete milestones.

== iCalendar Support ==

The Roadmap supports the [http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt iCalendar] format so that you can keep track of planned milestones and related tickets from your favorite calendaring software. Calendar applications that support the iCalendar specification include [http://www.apple.com/ical/ Apple iCal] for Mac OS X and the cross-platform [http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/ Mozilla Calendar]. To subscribe to the roadmap from one of those applications, copy the iCalendar link from the roadmap (usually found at the bottom of the page) and choose the "Subscribe to remote calendar" action (or similar), inserting the URL you just copied.

''Note that for tickets to be included in the calendar (as TO-DO items), you need to be authenticated when copying the link. You will only see tickets assigned to yourself, and associated with a milestone.''
