= Email Notification of Ticket Changes =
Trac supports automatic email notification upon ticket changes. 

'''Note:''' This feature is disabled by default, and must be configured to be activated.

== Receiving Notification ==
When reporting a new ticket or adding a comment, if you enter a valid email address in the ''reporter'', ''editor'' or ''cc'' field, you will automatically receive an email upon future changes to the ticket.

This is useful to keep up-to-date on an issue or enhancement request that interests you.

== Configuring SMTP Notification ==

=== Config Options ===
These are the available options for the ''[notification]'' section in trac.ini.
 * '''smtp_enabled''': Enable notification.
 * '''smtp_server''': SMTP server used for notification messages.
 * '''smtp_replyto''': Email address to use for ''Reply-To''-headers in notification emails.
 * '''smtp_always_cc''': List of email addresses to always send notifications to. ''Typically used to post ticket changes to a dedicated mailing list.''

=== Example Configuration ===

{{{
[notification]
smtp_enabled = true
smtp_server = mail.example.com
smtp_replyto = myproj@projects.example.com
smtp_always_cc = ticketmaster@example.com, theboss+myproj@example.com
}}}
