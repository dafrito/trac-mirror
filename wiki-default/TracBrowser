= The Trac Browser =

The Trac browser can be used to browse directories, change logs 
and specific revisions of files stored in a subversion repository.

Directory entries are displayed in a list with sortable columns. The list 
entries can be sorted '''by name''', '''size''' or '''date''' by clicking on the column headers.
The sorting order can be reversed by clicking on a given column header again.

The browser can be used to navigate through the directory structure 
by clicking on the directory names. Clicking on filenames on the other 
hand will display the files change log.

It's also possible to browse directories as they were at any given repository revision. 
The default behavior is to use the information from the latest revision but
another revision can easily be selected using the form at the top of the
page.

== RSS Support ==
The browser module supports RSS 2.0 syndication of changes to a single file. To subscribe to an RSS version of the revision log for a file, open a file log in the browser, and click the orange 'XML' icon at the bottom of the page. See TracRss for more information on RSS support in Trac.
