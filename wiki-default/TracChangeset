= Trac Changeset Module =
Trac has a built-in functionality for visualizing diffs - changes to files.

== The Changeset View ==

When viewing a commited changeset, such as when clicking a changeset
[wiki:TracLinks TracLink] or a changeset event-line in the 
[wiki:TracTimeline timeline], Trac will display what changes this current set of patches imposes.

The changeset view consists of two parts, the '''header''' and the '''diff view'''.

=== Changeset Header ===

The diff body shows an overview of the whole changeset.
Here you will find information such as:

 * Revision -- The unique revision ID for this changeset.
 * Timestamp -- When the changeset was commited.
 * Author -- Who commited the changeset.
 * Message -- A brief description from the author (the commit log message).
 * Files -- A list of files affected by this changeset.

In front of each listed file, you'll find  a colored rectangle. The color
indicates how the file is affected by the changeset.
 
 * Green: Added
 * Red: Removed
 * Orange: Modified

The color legend is located below the header as a reminder.

=== Diff View ===
Below the header is the main part of the changeset, the diff view.

Each file is shown in a separate section, divided by a dashed line in the
center. This is a '''side-by-side''' view showing only the portions of the file
affected by this changeset.

On the left hand side are the contents of the old version of the file, on the
right side the new. To visualize the difference between the old and new
version, each block of lines altered by the changeset has a colored
background. The color reflect the change, and the meaning the same as in the
header (see above).
