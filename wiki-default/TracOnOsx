= Installing and running Trac on Mac OSX =

Fink (http://fink.sf.net/) can be used to install most of Trac's dependencies:
{{{
 $ apt-get install sqlite
 $ apt-get install svn-client svn-swig-py23
}}}

If you need to use a secure protocol with subversion, you need to install the -ssl variants:
{{{
 $ apt-get install svn-client-ssl svn-ssl-swig-py23
}}}

The last two dependencies (pysqlite and clearsilver) can't be installed using fink, 
you have to download and install them manually.

== Clearsilver ==

Download latest version from http://www.clearsilver.net/. Compile it with Python 
support and install it in the fink prefix.
{{{
 $ ./configure --prefix=/sw/ --with-python=/sw/bin/python2.3
 $ make install
}}}
You might have to modify some some hard coded /usr/local/bin/python path to /sw/bin/python2.3 
in some file when running {{{make install}}}.

== pysqlite ==

The file {{{setup.py}}} in the pysqlite distribution doesn't recognize the darwin platform so you'll
have to add the following lines to {{{setup.py}}} (it should be quite obvious where):
{{{
elif sys.platform == "darwin":
    include_dirs = ['/sw/include/']
    library_dirs = ['/sw/lib/']
    libraries = [sqlite]
    runtime_library_dirs = []
    extra_objects = []
}}}

After that modification the installation should simply be:
{{{
 $ /sw/bin/python2.3 ./setup.py install
}}}

== Installing Trac itself ==

You should now be all set to install Trac using the TracInstall instructions. Make sure to use
{{{/sw/bin/python2.3}}} when running the {{{setup.py}}} script.

I had some problems getting apples personal web-server (apache 1.3) to run trac.cgi with the correct
python interpreter (/sw/bin/python2.3) so I placed this dummy {{{trac.cgi}}} in
{{{/Library/WebServer/CGI-Executables/}}}:
{{{
#! /bin/sh
/sw/bin/python2.3 /somewhere/cgi-bin/trac.cgi
}}}


Keep in mind that these instructions were written from the top of my mind and might be
incomplete and contain some errors. If you find any errors please correct them by
editing this page and/or contacting me -- [http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/JonasBorgstrom JonasBorgstrom]

== Alternative install method: pkgsrc ==

As an alternative to fink and compiling by hand, you can install from pkgsrc (http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/software/packages.html).  Yes, pkgsrc runs on Mac OS X just as well as it runs on NetBSD or Linux.

See TracOnNetBsd for more information.
