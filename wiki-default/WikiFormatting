= WikiFormatting =

Trac implements a simple Wiki engine. The main goal is to have a simple small
and fast engine that uses the same command syntax as other well known wikis, especially [http://moin.sf.net/ MoinWiki]. The wiki also serves as the core 
component of Trac, which tightly integrates all the other parts of Trac into
flexible and powerful system.

This page will demonstrate some of the formatting commands available in the Trac Wiki.

== Font styles ==

The Trac wiki support the following font styles: '''bold''', ''italic''
and __underline__.

== Heading ==

You can create heading by starting a line with one up to five equal signs
followed by a space and the headline text. The line should end with a space 
followed by the same number of equal signs. 

=== Example: ===
{{{
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
}}}


== Paragraphs ==

A new text paragraph is created whenever two blocks of text are separated
by an empty line. A newline can also be inserted like this:
{{{
Line 1[[BR]]Line 2
}}}
Display:

Line 1[[BR]]Line 2

 Text paragraphs can also be indented by starting the lines with a few spaces.
== Lists ==
Example:
{{{
 * Item 1
   * Item 1.1
 * Item 2

 1. Item 1
   1. Item 1.1
 1. Item 2
}}}
Display:
 * Item 1
   * Item 1.1
 * Item 2

 1. Item 1
   1. Item 1.1
 1. Item 2

== Links ==

Hyperlinks are automatically created for wiki names and urls. For example:

 TitleIndex, http://www.edgewall.com/.

Links can be given a move descriptive title by writing the link followed by
a space and a title and all this inside two square brackets. Like this:
{{{
 * [http://www.edgewall.com/ Edgewall Software]
 * [wiki:TitleIndex Title Index]
}}}
Display:

 * [http://www.edgewall.com/ Edgewall Software]
 * [wiki:TitleIndex Title Index]

=== Intra Trac Links ===

Trac allows wiki pages to link directly to other parts of the Trac system.
Pages can refer to tickets, reports and changesets by simply writing the
ticket, report and changeset numbers in the following notation:
{{{
 * Ticket #1 
 * Report {1}
 * Changeset [1]
 * File svn:trunk/COPYING.
}}}
Display:
 * Ticket #1 
 * Report {1}
 * Changeset [1]
 * File svn:trunk/COPYING.

== Images ==

Urls ending with .png, .gif or .jpg will be converted to an IMG-tag.

Example:
{{{
http://www.edgewall.com/gfx/media/edgewall_logo_symbol_only_152x142.png
}}}
Display:

http://www.edgewall.com/gfx/media/edgewall_logo_symbol_only_152x142.png


== Other stuff ==

Four or more dashes will be replaced by a horizontal line (<HR>)
