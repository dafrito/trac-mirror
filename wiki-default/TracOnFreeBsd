= Installing Trac on FreeBSD =

Kuei-Feng Li, Rui Lopes and Pav Lucistnik kindly [http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=ports/65690 added] Trac to the [http://www.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD] ports collection.

For more information:
 * http://www.freebsd.org/ports/
 * http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/www/trac/

= Having trouble using the ports ? =

You may have to use some additional ports from [http://www.freshports.org freshports].
I found these ones useful:

 * [http://www.freshports.org/devel/subversion-python subversion-python]
 * [http://www.freshports.org/www/clearsilver-python clearsilver-python]
 * [http://www.freshports.org/www/clearsilver clearsilver]

Just add them to your /usr/ports tree before using the trac port mentioned above.
