== Welcome to your Trac installation ==

Trac is a '''minimalistic''' approach to '''web-based''' management of
'''software projects'''. Its goal is to simplify effective tracking of
software issues, enhancements and overall progress.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with the single goal to '''help
developers write great software''' while '''staying out of the way'''
and imposing as little as possible on a team's process.

"{{{[wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] ''yourdatabase.db'' initdb}}}" created
a new database filled with a set of default wiki pages and some sample
data. You can use [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] to configure

especially in regard to ''components'', ''versions'' and
''milestones''.
