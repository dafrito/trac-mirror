= Welcome to the Trac Project =

Welcome to the [wiki:TracProject Trac open source project].

Trac is a minimalistic web-based software project management and bug/issue
tracking system. It provides an interface to revision control systems
([http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion]), an integrated Wiki and convenient report facilities. 

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, to create 
links and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and wiki
pages.  A timeline shows all project events in order, making getting an
overview of the project and tracking progress very easy.
