= Trac Installation Guide =

The Trac web-based project management tool is implemented as a server
side cgi-program. Trac is written in the Python programming language
and uses SQLite as an embedded database. For HTML rendering, Trac uses the Clearsilver template system.


== Requirements ==

To install Trac, the following software packages must be installed:

 * [http://www.python.org/ Python], version >= 2.1.
 * [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion], version >= 0.37. (>=1.0.1 recommended)
 * [http://subversion.tigris.org/ Subversion Python bindings].
 * [http://pysqlite.sf.net/ pysqlite], version >= 0.4.3 (>= 0.5 for better performance)
 * [http://clearsilver.net/ Clearsilver], version >= 0.9.3
 * A CGI-capable web server (we QA-test on [http://httpd.apache.org/ Apache2] )

== Installing Trac ==
{{{
$ python ./setup.py install
}}}

This will byte-compile the python source code and install it in the {{{site-packages}}} directory
of your python installation. The directories {{{cgi-bin}}}, {{{templates}}}, {{{htdocs}}} and {{{wiki-default}}} are all copied to $prefix/share/trac/ . 

The script will also install the [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] command-line tool, used to create and maintain project databases. Trac-admin is the ''command center'' of Trac.

=== Advanced Users ===
To install Trac in a different location, and other advanced installation options, run:
{{{
$ python ./setup.py --help
}}}

== Creating a Project Database ==

Trac stores wiki pages, tickets and all other information in a single embedded SQLite database. 
SQLite databases are stored as a single ordinary file on your filesystem, no separate database server
or environment is required.

A new trac database is created with {{{trac-admin}}}:

{{{
$ trac-admin /path/to/mydatabase.db initdb
}}}
'''Note:''' The database file have to be located in a directory where the web server
user has write permission to both the file and the directory.

[wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] will ask you where your subversion repository is located and
where it can find the trac templates directory (the default value should be fine).

== Configuring Apache ==

Copy (or symlink) "{{{trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi}}}" to 
you web servers {{{/cgi-bin/}}} directory. You can also configure apache
to use the "{{{trac/cgi-bin/}}}" directory directly if you like, it's a matter of taste.

Finally edit the apache config and add this config snippet, with filenams edited to match your installation:
 
{{{
Alias /trac/ "/where/you/put/trac/htdocs/"
# Trac need to know where the database is located
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
	SetEnv TRAC_DB "/somewhere/myproject.db"
</Location>

# You need this to allow users to authenticate
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
	AuthType Basic
	AuthName "trac"
	AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd
	Require valid-user
</location>
}}}

'''Note:''' When creating a new database, {{{trac-admin}}} will print a config snippet customized for your project.

== Using Trac ==

You should now have a working Trac installation at:

http://<yourhostname>/cgi-bin/trac.cgi

There you should be able to browse your subversion repository, create tickets,
view the timeline etc. Keep in mind that anonymous users (not logged in)
can only access a restricted subset of all Trac features. 

Please continue to TracPermissions to learn how to grant additional privileges to authenticated users.
