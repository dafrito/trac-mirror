= The Trac Timeline =
[[TracGuideToc]]

The timeline provides a historic view of the project in a single report.

It lists all Trac events that have occurred in chronological order, a
brief description of each event and if applicable, the person responsible for
the change.

The timeline lists these kinds of events:
 * '''Wiki page events''' -- Creation and changes
 * '''Ticket events''' -- Creation and resolution/closing (and optionally other changes)
 * '''Source code changes ''' -- Repository check-ins
 * '''Milestone ''' -- Milestone completed

Each event entry provides a hyperlink to the specific event in question, as well as
a brief excerpt of the actual comment or text, if available.
The author of the change is also mentioned.

It is possible to filter those events by authors. The option panel contains a ''done by'' field which accepts a space-separated list of authors for which events should be included. Alternatively, if the author names are prefixed by a "-" character, then the events having those authors will be excluded, and all the others included. Single or double quotes can be used for specifying author names containing space characters.
''(since 0.12)''
