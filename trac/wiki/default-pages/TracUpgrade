[[TracGuideToc]]

A [wiki:TracEnvironment Trac environment] needs to be upgraded before it can be used with Trac-0.11. This document describes the steps necessary to upgrade an environment.

 '''Note''': ''Environment upgrades are not necessary for minor version releases unless otherwise noted. 

 '''Note''': ''A database change is required, so it is no longer safe to switch back from 0.11 to 0.10.

 '''Beware:''' milestone:0.11 still says it is safe to switch between 0.10.4 and 0.11dev

== Instructions ==

Typically, there are four steps involved in upgrading to a newer version of Trac:

=== Update the Trac Code ===

Get the new version as described in TracInstall, or your operation system specific procedure.

If you do a manual (not operating system specific) upgrade, you may also later on want to remove the existing Trac code by deleting the `trac` directory from the Python `lib/site-packages` directory.

The location of the site-packages directory depends on the operating system, and the location in which Python was installed. However, the following locations are common:
 * If you’re using Linux: /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages
 * If you’re using Windows: C:\Python2.X\lib\site-packages
 * If you’re using MacOSX: /Library/Python2.X/site-packages

You may also want to remove the Trac `cgi-bin`, `htdocs`, `templates` and `wiki-default` directories that are commonly found in a directory called `share/trac` (the exact location depends on your platform).

> If You had the webadmin components, You should disable (remove from config file) webadmin.* -  now Admin is part of the Trac code base.



=== Upgrade the Trac Environment ===

After restarting, Trac should show the instances which need a manual upgrade via the automated upgrade scripts to ease the pain. These scripts are run via [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin]:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade
}}}

This command will do nothing if the environment is already up-to-date.

Note that if you are using a PostgreSQL database, this command will fail with the message that the environment can only be backed up when you use an SQLite database. This means that you will have to backup the repository and the database manually. Then, to perform the actual upgrade, run:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade --no-backup
}}}

=== Update the Trac Documentation ===

Every [wiki:TracEnvironment Trac environment] includes a copy of the Trac documentation for the installed version. As you probably want to keep the included documentation in sync with the installed version of Trac, [wiki:TracAdmin trac-admin] provides a command to upgrade the documentation:
{{{
trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki upgrade
}}}

Note that this procedure will of course leave your `WikiStart` page intact.

=== Trac Macros, Plugins ===
The Trac macros will need to be adapted, as the old-style wiki-macros are not supported anymore (due to the drop of ClearSilver and the HDF); they need to be converted to the new-style macros.


=== Restart the Web Server ===
If you are not running [wiki:TracCgi CGI], reload the new Trac code by restarting your web server.

== Known Issues ==
=== parent dir ===
If you use a trac parent env configuration and one of the plugines in one child does not work, none of the children work.

== Changing Database Backend ==
== SQLite to PostgreSQL ==

The [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/SqliteToPgScript sqlite2pg] script on [http://trac-hacks.org trac-hacks.org] has been written to assist in migrating a SQLite database to a PostgreSQL database

== Older Versions ==

For upgrades from former versions refer to TracUpgrade.
