= Tracd =

Tracd is a lightweight standalone Trac web server. In most cases it's easier to setup and runs faster than the [wiki:TracCgi CGI script].

== Pros ==

 * Fewer dependencies: You don't need to install apache or any other web-server.
 * Fast: Should be almost as fast as the [wiki:TracModPython mod_python] version (and much faster than the [wiki:TracCgi CGI]).
 * Automatic reloading: For development, Tracd can be used in ''auto_reload'' mode, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make a change to the code (in Trac itself or in a plugin).

== Cons ==

 * Fewer features: Tracd implements a very simple web-server and is not as configurable or as scalable as Apache HTTPD.
 * No native HTTPS support: [http://www.rickk.com/sslwrap/ sslwrap] can be used instead,
   or [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/STunnelTracd stunnel -- a tutorial on how to use stunnel with tracd] or Apache with mod_proxy.

== Usage examples ==

A single project on port 8080. (http://localhost:8080/)
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 /path/to/project
}}}
Stricly speaking this will make your Trac accessible to everybody from your network rather than ''localhost only''. To truly limit it use ''--hostname'' option.
{{{
 $ tracd --hostname=localhost -p 8080 /path/to/project
}}}
With more than one project. (http://localhost:8080/project1/ and http://localhost:8080/project2/)
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2
}}}

You can't have the last portion of the path identical between the projects since Trac uses that name to keep the URLs of the
different projects unique. So if you use `/project1/path/to` and `/project2/path/to`, you will only see the second project.

An alternative way to serve multiple projects is to specify a parent directory in which each subdirectory is a Trac project, using the `-e` option. The example above could be rewritten:
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 -e /path/to
}}}

To exit the server on Windows, be sure to use {{{CTRL-BREAK}}} -- using {{{CTRL-C}}} will leave a Python process running in the background.


== Using Authentication ==

Tracd provides support for both Basic and Digest authentication. The default is to use Digest; to use Basic authentication, replace `--auth` with `--basic-auth` in the examples below. (You must still specify a dialogic "realm", which can be an empty string by trailing the BASICAUTH with a comma.)

  ''Support for Basic authentication was added in version 0.9.''

The general format for using authentication is:

{{{
 $ tracd -p port --auth=base_project_dir,password_file_path,realm project_path
}}}

where:

 * '''base_project_dir''' is the base directory of the project; note: this doesn't refer to the project name, and it is case-sensitive even for windows environments
 * '''password_file_path''' path of the password file
 * '''realm''' realm
 * '''project_path''' path of the project

Example:

{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 \
   --auth=project1,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com /path/to/project1
}}}
Of course, the digest file can be be shared so that it is used for more than one project:
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 \
   --auth=project1,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com \
   --auth=project2,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com \
   /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2
}}}

Another way to share the digest file is to specify "*"
for the project name:
{{{
 $ tracd -p 8080 \
   --auth=*,/path/to/users.htdigest,mycompany.com \
   /path/to/project1 /path/to/project2
}}}

== How to set up an htdigest password file ==

If you have Apache available, you can use the htdigest command to generate the password file. Type 'htdigest' to get some usage instructions, or read [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/htdigest.html this page] from the Apache manual to get precise instructions.  You'll be prompted for a password to enter for each user that you create.  For the name of the password file, you can use whatever you like, but if you use something like `users.htdigest` it will remind you what the file contains. As a suggestion, put it in your <projectname>/conf folder along with the [TracIni trac.ini] file.

Note that you can start tracd without the --auth argument, but if you click on the ''Login'' link you will get an error.

== Generating Passwords Without Apache ==

If you don't have Apache available, you can use this simple Python script to generate your passwords:

{{{
#!python
from optparse import OptionParser
import md5

# build the options
usage = "usage: %prog [options]"
parser = OptionParser(usage=usage)
parser.add_option("-u", "--username",action="store", dest="username", type = "string",
                  help="the username for whom to generate a password")
parser.add_option("-p", "--password",action="store", dest="password", type = "string",
                  help="the password to use")
(options, args) = parser.parse_args()

# check options
if (options.username is None) or (options.password is None):
   parser.error("You must supply both the username and password")
   
# Generate the string to enter into the htdigest file
realm = 'trac'
kd = lambda x: md5.md5(':'.join(x)).hexdigest()
print ':'.join((options.username, realm, kd([options.username, realm, options.password])))
}}}

Note: If you use the above script you must use the --auth option to tracd, not --basic-auth, and you must set the realm in the --auth value to 'trac' (without the quotes). Example usage (assuming you saved the script as trac-digest.py):

{{{
python trac-digest.py -u username -p password >> c:\digest.txt
tracd --port 8000 --auth=proj_name,c:\digest.txt,trac c:\path\to\proj_name
}}}

Note: If you would like to use --basic-auth you need to use htpasswd tool from apache server to generate .htpasswd file. The remaining part is similar but make sure to use empty realm (i.e. coma after path). When using on Windows make sure to use -m option for it (did not tested it on *nix, so not sure if that is the case there).

== Tips ==

=== Serving static content ===

If `tracd` is the only webserver used for the project, 
it can also be used to distribute static content 
(tarballs, Doxygen documentation, etc.)

This static content should be put in the `$TRAC_ENV/htdocs` folder,
and is accessed by URLs like `<project_URL>/chrome/site/...`.

Example: given a `$TRAC_ENV/htdocs/software-0.1.tar.gz` file,
the corresponding relative URL would be `/<project_name>/chrome/site/software-0.1.tar.gz`, 
which in turn can be written using the relative link syntax
in the Wiki: `[/<project_name>/chrome/site/software-0.1.tar.gz]` 

The development version of Trac supports a new `htdocs:` TracLinks 
syntax for the above. With this, the example link above can be written simply 
`htdocs:software-0.1.tar.gz`. 

=== Using apache rewrite rules ===
If for some reason you choose to use tracd behind apache, you should define the base_url in the trac section of the trac.ini. If you don't, all POSTS will fail. Trac tries to redirect the request and transform the POST url to a GET url, during that transition, it tries to calculate the correct redirect url, not knowing about the redirect rule of apache.
Note that with [milestone:0.11], setting the `base_url` will be strongly recommended anyway.

=== Serving a different base path than / ===
Tracd supports serving projects with different base urls then /<project>. The parameter name to change this is
{{{
tracd --base-path=/some/path
}}}
