Upgrade Instructions
====================

Upgrading to 0.6.1 from 0.6
-----------------------------
* There are no changes to the database in 0.6.1.
  Just install the new version of Trac by running the installer (.exe for
  windows), or otherwise:  ./setup.py install 


Upgrading to 0.6 from 0.5.x  
-----------------------------
* There are no changes to the database schema in 0.6, so existing Trac
  databases don't require any extra steps.

  Just install the new version of Trac by running:  ./setup.py install 

* There are now a set of default wiki pages included in the install,
  automatically imported upon creating a new database with the 
  'trac-admin initdb' command.

  If you wish to add these pages to an already existing [older] Trac database,
  you can import the pages manually using trac-admin:
   
       1. When running 'setup.py install', note where the install script
          copies the 'wiki-default' directory. 
          Default is ($prefix/share/trac/wiki-default)

       2. Use trac-admin to load the wiki pages. 
          Example:
      
            trac-admin myproject.db wiki upgrade

       3. All done. Please note that you have to repeat this step for each
          Trac database you wish to upgrade.
