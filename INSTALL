Trac Installation Guide
=======================
The Trac web-based project management tool is implemented as a server side
cgi-program. Trac is written in the Python programming language and uses SQLite
as an embedded database. For HTML rendering, Trac uses the Clearsilver template
system.

Requirements
------------
To install Trac, the following software packages must be installed:

  * Python, version >= 2.1.
      + Please keep in mind, that for RPM-based systems you will also need
        python-devel and python-xml packages.
  * Subversion, version >= 1.0. (>=1.0.5 recommended)
  * Subversion Python bindings.
  * PySQLite, version >= 0.5.
  * Clearsilver, version >= 0.9.3
  * A CGI-capable web server (we QA-test on Apache2 )

Installing Trac
---------------
    $ python ./setup.py install

This will byte-compile the python source code and install it in the
site-packages directory of your python installation. The directories cgi-bin,
templates, htdocs and wiki-default are all copied to $prefix/share/trac/ .

The script will also install the trac-admin command-line tool, used to create
and maintain project environments. Trac-admin is the command center of Trac.

Note: you'll need root permissions or equivalent for this step.

Advanced Users
--------------
To install Trac in a different location, and other advanced installation
options, run:

    $ python ./setup.py --help

Installing Trac on Windows
--------------------------
If you downloaded the Trac installer (the .exe file), installing is simply a
matter of running the installer. 

 * NOTE: The windows installer also includes the Clearsilver DLL, so you do
         _NOT_ have to install it manually when using the installer.

After running the installer, configuration and installation is the same as
for other platforms.

Creating a Project Environment
------------------------------
Trac Environment is the backend storage format where Trac stores information
like wiki pages, tickets, reports, settings, etc. A Trac environment consist of
a directory containing an SQLite database, human-readable configuration file,
log-files and attachments.

A new Trac environment is created with trac-admin:

    $ trac-admin /path/to/projectenv initenv

Note: The web server user need write permission to the environment directory
and all the files inside.

trac-admin will ask you where your subversion repository is located and where
it can find the trac templates directory (the default value should be fine).

Configuring Apache
------------------
Copy (or symlink) "trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi" to you web servers /cgi-bin/
directory. You can also configure apache to use the "trac/cgi-bin/" directory
directly if you like, it's a matter of taste.

Finally edit the apache config and add this config snippet, with filenams
edited to match your installation:

Alias /trac/ "/usr/share/trac/htdocs/" #or where you installed the trac docs
#You have to allow people to read the files in htdocs
<Directory "/usr/share/trac/htdocs/">
        Options Indexes MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>


# Trac need to know where the database is located
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
        SetEnv TRAC_ENV "/path/to/projectenv"
</Location>

# You need this to allow users to authenticate
# trac.htpasswd can be created with 
# cmd 'htpasswd -c trac.htpasswd' (UNIX)
# do 'man htpasswd' to see all the options
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "trac"
        AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
</location>

Note: When creating a new environment, trac-admin will print a config snippet
customized for your project.

Using Trac
----------
You should now have a working Trac installation at:

http://<yourhostname>/cgi-bin/trac.cgi

There you should be able to browse your subversion repository, create tickets,
view the timeline etc. Keep in mind that anonymous users (not logged in) can
only access a restricted subset of all Trac features.

Please continue to TracPermissions to learn how to grant additional privileges
to authenticated users.

For further user-documentation, see TracGuide.

Enjoy!
