Trac Installation Guide
=======================
The Trac web-based project management tool is implemented as a server side
cgi-program. Trac is written in the Python programming language and store it's
data in a sqlite database.

Dependencies
------------
The following dependencies have to be installed:

  * Python, version >= 2.1.
  * Subversion, version >= 0.37. (>=1.0.1 recommended)
  * Subversion Python bindings.
  * pysqlite, version >= 0.4.3 (>= 0.5 for better performance)
  * ClearSilver, version >= 0.9.3
  * A CGI-capable web server (We QA-test on Apache)

Installing Trac
---------------
        $ python ./setup.py install

This will byte-compile the python source code and install it in the
site-packages directory of your python installation. The directories
cgi-bin, templates, htdocs and wiki-default will all be copied into
$prefix/share/trac/ .

For more install configuration options, run 'python ./setup.py --help'.

Installing Trac on Windows
--------------------------
If you downloaded the Trac installer (the .exe file), installing is simply a
matter of running the installer. 

 * NOTE: The windows installer also includes the Clearsilver DLL, so you do
         _NOT_ have to install it manually when using the installer.

After running the installer, configuration and installation is the same as
for other platforms.

Initializing the database
-------------------------
Trac stores wiki pages, tickets and other information in a sqlite database.
Sqlite databases are just ordinary files on the hard drive, no database server
is required.

A new trac database can be created like this:

        $ trac-admin /path/to/mydatabase.db initdb

NOTE: The database file have to be located in a directory where the web server
user has write permission to both the file and the directory.

trac-admin will ask you where your subversion repository is located and where
it can find the trac templates directory (the default value should be fine).

Configuring Apache
------------------
copy (or symlink) "trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi" to you web servers /cgi-bin/
directory. Of course you can configure apache to use the "trac/cgi-bin/"
directory directly if you like.

Finally adjust the filenames and add this config snippet to your web server:

Alias /trac/ "/where/you/put/trac/htdocs/"
# Trac need to know where the database is located
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
        SetEnv TRAC_DB "/somewhere/myproject.db"
</Location>

# You need this to allow users to authenticate
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
        AuthType Basic
        AuthName "trac"
        AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
</location>

What next?
----------
You should now have a working Trac installation at:

http://<yourhostname>/cgi-bin/trac.cgi

There you should be able to browse your subversion repository, create tickets,
view the timeline etc. Keep in mind that anonymous users (before logging in)
are only able to see/use a subset of all the features provided by Trac. Please
read TracPermissions on how to grant additional privileges to authenticated
users.

Enjoy!
