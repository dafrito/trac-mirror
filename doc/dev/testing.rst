Testing in Trac
===============

So, you'd like to make sure Trac works in your configuration.  Excellent.
Here's what you need to know.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   testing-plugins.rst
   testing-core.rst
   testing-environment.rst
   testing-database.rst

.. TODO how can I incude this document's tree in here as well?


.. index::
    pair: tests; prerequisites

Prerequisites
-------------

Beyond the standard installation prereqs, you also need:

* `Pygments <http://pygments.org/>`_ (0.8+)
* `Twill <http://twill.idyll.org/>`_ (0.9+)
* `Figleaf <http://figleaf.idyll.org>`_ (0.6.1+, for coverage [optional])

Additionally, if you're on Windows, you need to get fcrypt.  See
`Prerequisites on Windows`_ below for more information.


.. index::
    pair: tests; running

Invoking the tests
------------------

Just run :command:`make test` in the Trac tree once you have everything installed.
This will run the unit tests first, then the functional tests (if you have the
dependencies) against sqlite.  On a reasonably fast machine, the former takes
10 seconds and the latter a couple of minutes.  If you're running them on
Windows, you'll need to manually run the tests using :command:`python
trac\\test.py`, but this will run all the tests interleaved.  Examine the
:file:`Makefile` if you want more control.




Understanding failures
----------------------

Functional test failures can happen a few different ways.

:Running trac-admin fails every time:
    Make sure the prereqs are met.  In particular, that new enough Genshi is
    available and has `setup.py egg_info` run.
:Repo creation fails:
    Subversion is required for the tests; they are not designed to run without
    it.
:Repo creation works, other repo access fails:
    Probably a mismatch in svn bindings versus the :command:`svn` binary.
:Twill errors which save to HTML:
    Check the html and see if there's a traceback contained in it.  Chances
    are it has an obvious traceback with an error -- these are triggered on
    the server, not the tester, so they're difficult for us to show in the
    failure itself.

    If you can't decipher what the problem is from viewing
    the HTML, run the server manually and see what state that particular page
    is in.
:Random weird platform issues:
    Please report them.
:Can't remove files on Windows:
    Ugh.  Please report them.
:Reload tests fail:
    Chances are, you're on a Windows VM that has an unstable clock and FAT32
    filesystem (which has a granularity of several seconds).  If that's not
    the case, report it.


Prerequisites on Windows
------------------------

* You need pywin32_, the appropriate `mfc dll`_, fcrypt_, and some changes
  perhaps if using older versions of Python.  See a `quick walkthrough
  <http://trac.timhatch.com/tracbuildbots/wiki/Install/Windows/SinglePythonXP>`_.

.. _pywin32: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
.. _mfc dll: http://python.net/crew/mhammond/win32/
.. _fcrypt: http://carey.geek.nz/code/python-fcrypt/

.. TODO write more, with testing-specific steps.
