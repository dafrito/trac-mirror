= Trac Installation Guide =

The Trac web-based project management tool is implemented as a server side
cgi-program. Trac is written in the Python programming language and store it's
data in a sqlite database.

== Dependencies ==

The following dependencies have to be installed:

  * Python, version >= 2.1.
  * subversion, version >= 0.29.
  * pysqlite, version >= 0.4.3
  * ClearSilver, version >= 0.9.3
  * A CGI-capable webserver (only tested with Apache)

== Installing Trac ==

 $ python ./setup.py build
 $ python ./setup.py install

== Initializing the database ==

Trac stores wiki pages, tickes and other information in a sqlite database.
Sqlite databases ar just ordinary files on the harddrive, no database server is
required.

A new trac database can be created like this:

 $ trac_admin.py /path/to/mydatabase.db initdb

NOTE: The database file have to be located in a directory where the webserver
user has write permission to both the file and the directory.

This creates a new database using default values. Some settings still need to
be modified to get your Trac installation up and running. The following command
will display the trac configuration:

 $ trac_admin.py /path/to/mydatabase.db config list

Most settings should be okey, but you have to verify that these settings are
correct:

  * general.repository_dir. This should be the path to the svn repository.
  * general.templates_dir. This should be the path to the trac template
    directory.

A config value is modified like this:

 $ trac_admin.py /path/to/mydatabase.db config set <name> <value>

== Configuring Apache ==

copy "trac/cgi-bin/trac.cgi" to you webservers /cgi-bin/ directory. Of course
you can configure apache to use the "trac/cgi-bin/" directory directly if you
like.

Finally adjust the filenames and add this config snippet to your webserver:

Alias /trac/ "/where/you/put/trac/htdocs/"
# Trac need to know where the database is located
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi">
     SetEnv TRAC_DB "/somewhere/myproject.db"
</Location>

# You need this to let users authenticate
<Location "/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/login">
     AuthType Basic
     AuthName "trac"
     AuthUserFile /somewhere/trac.htpasswd
     Require valid-user
</location>

== What next? ==

You should now have a working Trac installation at:

http://<yourhostname>/cgi-bin/trac.cgi

There you should be able to browse your subversion repository, create tickets,
view the timeline etc. Keep in mind that anonymous users (before logging in)
are only able to see/use a subset of all the features provided by Trac. Please
read TracPermissions on how to grant additional privileges to authenticated
users.

Enjoy!
